# Best Alfred Workflow for Speedtest
Test the Upload/Download speed of the network you're currently on.

## Installation

1. Install `speedtest` on your system using homebrew: 
`brew tap teamookla/speedtest`
`brew update`
`brew install speedtest --force`
`.
2. Download the [workflow](https://github.com/NKR00711/alfred-speedtest/raw/main/Speedtest.alfredworkflow).
3. Double click the downloaded workflow to install it in Alfred.

## Usage

Using the keyword `speedtest` in alfred, select the workflow then wait 30 seconds while the speedtest is running (a notification will appear letting you know it's started the test). After 30 seconds, view the notification that pops up with the results of the speedtest.

#### Note: This is just A Alfred Workflow that utilizes Official Speettest CLI to get better speedtest results.My Reason for making this is to get more accurate speedtest result in Alfred as the already available workflow showed around 10% of my actual speed shown on websiteðŸ¥².
